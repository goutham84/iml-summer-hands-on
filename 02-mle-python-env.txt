Steps:
    create a new environment using command conda create -n mle-py
    Activate the mle environment using command conda activate mle-py
    Install python in the environment using command conda install -c conda-forge python=3.8 #(the version of python is 3.8.17)
    Install requires libraries as numpy,matplotlib using command conda install numpy and then conda install matplotlib
    Also install ipython using command conda install ipython
    If required Install qt5 using the command conda install -c dsdale24 qt5 (or)
        For qt5 we can use another command if above doesn't work using the command conda install qt qt5;
    Now to write the code open ipython using the command ipython python IDLE will be ready to write the code.
    write the lines of code and run it.
    
Create a file in the folder:
    Exit the python IDLE in terminal using command exit()
    Type code . to run in vs code 
    create a file named 03-mle-python-surface-bd.py and write the code and run it.
    select interpreter as the  ~/miniconda/envs/mle-py/bin/python and run the code in the environment mle-py
    Save the figure using the code.
