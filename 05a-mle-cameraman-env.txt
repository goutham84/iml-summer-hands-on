Steps:
    create a new environment usingvusing command conda create -n mle-cameraman
    Activate the mle environment using command conda activate mle-cameraman
    Install python in the environment using command conda install -c conda-forge python=3.8 #(the version of python is 3.8.17)
    Install requires libraries as numpy,matplotlib using command conda install numpy and then conda install matplotlib
    Install the library scipy using the command conda install scipy
    Install opencv:
        Using the command conda install -c conda-forge opencv #if this doesn't work try with
                            (or)
        Deavtivate environment and then use the command sudo apt-get install python3-opencv 
        If some files are not fetched try again using the command  sudo apt-get install python3-opencv --fix-missing 
        Activate the environment using command conda activate mle-cameraman
    Also install ipython using command conda install ipython
    Now to write the code open ipython using the command ipython python IDLE will be ready to write the code.
    Run the codes by writing in the IDLE

To make file .py:
    Exit the python IDLE in terminal using command exit()
    Type code . to run in vs code 
    create a file named 05a-mle-cameraman-env.py and write the code and run it.
    Run the code by selecting interpreter as  ~/miniconda/envs/mle-cameraman/bin/python
    Save the figure using the code.
